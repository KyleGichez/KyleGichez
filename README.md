I am a software developer with experience in Javascript, Python3, Bootstrap 5, and Flask. I am an active learner with a growth mindset driven by success, entrepreneurship, and actively investing in the software development industry aiming to make the world a better place every day.

I am always fascinated with technology because of the revolutionary ideas that are implemented by software developers every single day. I am blessed to be part and parcel of a great and amazing team of software developers inspiring, mentoring, and teaching young aspiring techies currently based in Nairobi, Kenya.

For the past 2 years, I have professionally collaborated, learned, and gained experience in software MVC; designing, interpreting, developing, and testing software systems through hard work and dedication to my career in software development.

Without much further ado, let's put in work for great career success and achievements in our lives.💰 ✔️
